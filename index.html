I am a second year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at NC State University and a part of the <a href="https://wspr.csc.ncsu.edu/people.html" target="_blank"><b>WSPR lab</b></a>. I work on <b>VR Privacy & Safety</b> under the guidance of <b><a href="https://anupamdas.org">Dr. Anupam Das</a></b>. 

<br/><br/>

<align="justify">My research interest lies in establishing secure and protected VR experiences for users. I am currently working on studies exploring usable security, privacy and safety for VR.</align>

<!-- My research interest spans the area of system security and privacy, with an emphasis on developing data-driven techniques to study spam, abuse and fraud. I currently work on developing techniques to detect and characterize robocalls — a catch-all term for automated phone calls. Our work on characterizing robocalls won the 2020 First Place Internet Defense Prize and a Distinguished Paper Award. -->

<align="justify">Prior to my Ph.D., I was an Engineer at Qualcomm, where I worked on improving the efficiency of Snapdragon's Neural Signal Processor as part of the Software Architecture team. In the past, I have been a student researcher, academic rank holder, & held various positions of responsibility at National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, where I graduated with a B.Tech. (Hons.) in <i>Computer Science & Engineering</i> in 2019.</align>

<!-- I hope to make the world a better place through efficient & effective use of technology. 
    <p>By passion, I'm an avid reader of self-help books & consumer of feel-good fiction. I enjoy writing poetry, which I publish on my <a href="https://sbabhinaya.medium.com" target="_blank"><b>blog</b></a>. I also serve as the creative lead for <a href="https://medium.com/yogavaidhyam" target="_blank"><b>Yogavaidhyam</b></a>, a platform for learning Yoga Therapy based fitness practices. -->
