<i>Published in the proceedings of Grace Hopper Celebration India (GHCI), 2019</i><br/><br/>

There have been a number of chatbots developed for education. While many of them are designed to answer queries based on publicly available or predefined knowledge base, there is no possibility of customizing the information to be queried. There are no chatbots capable of generating self assessment quizzes based on any given document. This paper proposes a Question Answering and Quiz Generation Chatbot that allows a user to perform answer extraction and question generation on any input document.

<i>Published in the Journal of Hardware and Systems Security, 2018</i><br/><br/>

Graphics processing unit (GPU), although a powerful performance-booster, also has many security vulnerabilities. Due to these, the GPU can be vulnerable to stealthy malware. In this paper, we present a survey of techniques for analyzing and improving GPU security. We classify the works on key attributes to highlight their similarities and differences. Alongside informing users and researchers about GPU security techniques, this survey aims to increase their awareness about GPU security vulnerabilities and potential countermeasures.
